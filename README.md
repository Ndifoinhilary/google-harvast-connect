# Harvest-Connect
Harvest Connect is a sustainable food system web app that aims to address these issues by providing a platform for farmers to connect directly with distributors and consumers. It facilitates the listing and sale of surplus produce, enables users to search for products based on location, type, price, and sustainability criteria, and promotes transparency by providing information about farming practices, certifications, and environmental impact. The app also includes features for logistics and delivery management, community engagement, data analytics, and secure transactions. By bridging the gap between farmers, distributors, and consumers, Harvest Connect promotes sustainable food choices, reduces food waste, and empowers users to make informed decisions.
